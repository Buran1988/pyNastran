They are described in order of how current/stable they are:

1. cart3d_nastran_fsi
 - This was the project that stated pyNastran
 - Used to be fully implemented and validated, but needs some tests
 - Likely broken code to perform aero mapping from Cart3d to Nastran
 - Runs Nastran
 - Maps structural deflections to Cart3d
 - Iterates to convergence
 - needs a public example problem
 - created around v0.1 (updated since)
 - updated load mapping part to be far more general
